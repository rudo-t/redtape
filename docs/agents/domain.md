# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root
- **`docs/adr/`** — read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in

If any of these files don't exist, proceed silently. The `/grill-with-docs` skill creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## File structure

Single-context repo:

```
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/adr/
│   └── 0001-*.md
└── redtape/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (issue title, refactor proposal, test name), use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly:

> _Contradicts ADR-0001 (…) — but worth reopening because…_
